# foodweb
A web-based simulation of a food web designed to model ecological interactions using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project simulates the dynamics of a food web, visualizing interactions between various species such as predators, prey, and competitors. Users can interact with the simulation to observe changes in the ecosystem based on different scenarios.

Tools & Technologies:

HTML: Structuring the content and layout of the simulation.
CSS: Styling and responsive design to ensure compatibility across devices.
JavaScript: Creating dynamic interactions and visualizing the ecological relationships.
Methods:

DOM Manipulation: Utilized for updating and managing interactive elements within the simulation.
Event Handling: Implemented to capture user interactions and adjust the simulation accordingly.
Data Representation: Used JavaScript objects and arrays to model species and their interactions.
This project showcases the integration of web development technologies to create an engaging and educational tool for understanding ecological systems.
